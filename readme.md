This is a redesign of maxbrother.com developed in 2012, and located [here](git://github.com/mahbam42/mbSite.git). 

This version is a complete overhaul utilizing contemporary trends in webdesign, and an asp.net framework.

## To be added 

* Implement master pages 
* Create ascx controls for easy replication of units across the site
* Master the ridiculous 960 grid system (it's not <i>hard</i> just annoying) 
* Better implement SASS code base 
* Learn as much as possible in the process
